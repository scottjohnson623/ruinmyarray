# ruinmyarray

This was a quick project to get experience publishing a package to NPM.

To install, run npm install ruinmyarray  or yarn add ruinmyarray.

After importing / requiring the package in your file, you can access the "ruinArray" method to run a method on a array that loops through the array, rolls a random value from 1-6, and performs an action on the element in the array based on the result.
